### Move File

* The code assumes that the files are present in local directories on your computer's file system. To move files between FTP folders, you would need to use an FTP library or module in your preferred programming language. Review move_file_ftp.

* Navigate to the directory containing the script: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you saved the script. For example, if the script is saved on the desktop, you can use the command cd Desktop to navigate to the desktop directory.

* Run the script: In the terminal or command prompt, execute the command python move_file.py to run the script. This assumes that Python is added to your system's PATH environment variable. If Python is not added to the PATH, you may need to provide the full path to the Python executable, such as C:\Python\Python39\python.exe file_mover.py on Windows.
